{"config":{"system_prompt":"","model":"","temperature":0,"top_p":1,"framework":"nextjs-page-tailwind"},"prompts":[{"prompt":"I need a C++ program that simulates a system for managing a vehicle's fuel tanks and engine. The system should read commands from an input file and output results to an output file. The main functionalities are as follows:\n\n1. Start and stop the engine.\n2. Add new fuel tanks with a specified capacity.\n3. List all fuel tanks and print the count of fuel tanks.\n4. Remove a fuel tank by its ID.\n5. Connect or disconnect a fuel tank to/from the engine.\n6. List connected fuel tanks.\n7. Print the total fuel quantity and the total consumed fuel quantity.\n8. Print detailed information about a specific fuel tank.\n9. Fill a specific fuel tank with a specified quantity of fuel.\n10. Open or close a fuel tank's valve.\n11. Break or repair a fuel tank.\n12. The engine consumes fuel per second and has an internal tank with a specific capacity. The engine should absorb fuel from connected tanks when its internal capacity exceeds a threshold.\n13. The engine returns fuel to the tanks before stopping.\n14. The simulation runs until a 'stop_simulation' command is received.\n\nThe program should be object-oriented and include classes for the engine, fuel tanks, and the overall system. Each command should take 1 second, and the engine should consume fuel if running. Implement logic according to these specifications.","md5":"685e16f525b8f330d3c8ca48839155e1"}]}
